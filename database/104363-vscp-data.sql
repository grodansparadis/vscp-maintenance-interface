The data field contains the 8-bit CRC of the segment controller GUID and the time since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970) as a 32-bit value. A node that receive (and recognize) this event could respond with a CLASS1.INFORMATION, Type=9 event (HEARTBEAT) and should do so if it does not send out a regular heartbeat event.\r\n\r\nOther nodes can originate this event on the segment. For these nodes the data part, as specified below, should be omitted. A better choice for periodic heartbeat events from a node may be CLASS1.INFORMATION, Type=9 (HEARTBEAT)\r\n\r\nAll nodes that recognize this event should save the 8-bit CRC in non-volatile storage and use it on power up. When a node starts up on a segment it should begin to listen for the Segment controller heartbeat. When/if it is received the node compares it with the stored value and if equal and the node is assigned a nickname-ID it continues to its working mode. If different, the node has detected that it has been moved to a new segment and therefore must drop its nickname-ID and enters the configuration mode to obtain a new nickname-ID from the segment controller.\r\n\r\nIf the node is in working mode and its nickname-ID changes, the node should do a complete restart after first setting all controls to their default state.\r\n\r\nAs a segment can be without a segment controller this event is not available on all segments and is not mandatory.\r\nData byte 	Description\r\n0 	8-bit CRC of the segment controller GUID.\r\n1 	MSB of time since epoch (optional).\r\n2 	Time since epoch (optional).\r\n3 	Time since epoch (optional).\r\n4 	LSB of time since epoch (optional).\r\n\r\nUninitiated nodes have the CRC of the segment controller set to 0xFF.\r\n\r\nA node that is initialized on a segment and does not receive a Heartbeat can take the role of segment controller if it wishes to do so.

A segment controller can however keep track of nodes that it controls and reassign the ID to a node that it did not get a new node on-line event from. This is the method a segment controller uses to detect nodes that have been removed from the segment.\r\n\r\nFor the nickname discovery procedure this event is used as the probe. The difference between a probe and a new node on line is that the later has the same originating nickname as value in byte 0.\r\n\r\nIf a node send this event with the unassigned ID 0xFF and byte 0 set to 0xFF it has given up the search for a free ID.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that also level II nodes send this event when they come alive.
